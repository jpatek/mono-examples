The aim of this project is to create a bunch of very small programs that show how to write things in C# for mono.

This is more of a repository for me to learn how to code different interesting things and then to be able to refer to them in the future.

Some example programs that I plan to write are:
  * Rewriting all of the examples from the book "Foundations of GTK+ Development" in GTK# (you can buy this book here: http://www.gtkbook.com/)
  * Examples of how to use NDesk's "managed DBus"
  * Examples of how to use gnome-keyring-sharp
